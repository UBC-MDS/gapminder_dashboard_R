## Decription of the app

The Gapminder dataset is a great source of information to learn about the world. The main objective of this app is to investigate what the young population of students know and donâ€™t know about basic global patterns and macro-trends and educate the intended users on global development trends. This dashboard has been developed to communicate insights about historical social/economic trends and create a better understanding of using and teaching statistics.
